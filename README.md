# QuaxTrip

*Update 09/11/20: A new version, that uses pd~ to encapsulate Pd within Max is under development and will be available soon. In the meantime, you can download the old version that uses the VST [over in releases](https://github.com/damonholzborn/QuaxTrip/releases/tag/quaxtrip-2020-0809).*

*Update 09/24/20: The pd~ version is now in beta and appears to be working OK. No official release yet, but you can get the latest through a git clone or download the Code zip file.*

Max patch encapsulating Miller Puckette's [QuackTrip](http://msp.ucsd.edu/tools/quacktrip/), a Pd implementation of [JackTrip](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/jacktrip/).

Documentation coming soon. If you've accidentally stumbled upon this page, and you are already familiar with QuackTrip and are comfortable in Max, you can probably figure out how to use the patch. Otherwise, [contact me](mailto:damon@rustleworks.com) I'll let you know when the patch is ready for general use.
