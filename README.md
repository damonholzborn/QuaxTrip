# QuaxTrip

Max patch encapsulating the [Quack4](https://github.com/fdch/Quack4), a VST version of Miller Puckette's [QuackTrip](http://msp.ucsd.edu/tools/quacktrip/), a Pd implementation of [JackTrip](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/jacktrip/).

Documentation coming soon. If you've accidentally stumbled upon this page, and you are already familiar with QuackTrip and are comfortable in Max, you can probably figure out how to use the patch. Otherwise, [contact me](mailto:damon@rustleworks.com) I'll let you know when the patch is ready for general use.
