Quacktrip is an implementation, in Pure Data, of Chris Chafe's Jacktrip network
protocol, based on jacktrip.pd by Roman Haefeli and Johannes Schuett.  It
establishes a low-latency, point-to-point connection between two sites, with
no audio compression.  Quacktrip is available as Mac and PC apps, as patches
you can load yourself into Pure Data, and as VST plug-ins (VST2 and VST3 for
Mac, VST3 only for PC.)

Netty McNetface connects up to eight musicians, with the help of a central
server, set up on a machine with a public IP address, that repeats audio from
each to all the others.  Each musician can make her own mix of all the signals.
